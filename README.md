🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis
This project explores passenger data from the Titanic disaster to uncover patterns and insights related to survival, using data analysis and visualization techniques in Python.

📊 Project Overview
The goal of this analysis is to understand the factors that influenced a passenger's chance of survival. The dataset includes demographic and ticketing details such as age, sex, fare, and class. Through statistical and visual analysis, the project highlights key survival trends.

📁 Files Included
titanic survials.ipynb – The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis and visualizations.

Titanic Survival Analysis Report.pdf – A detailed PDF report summarizing findings with charts and commentary.

🔍 Key Findings
Gender Impact: Women had a survival rate of ~75%, while only ~20% of men survived.

Class Privilege: 1st class passengers had the highest survival rate (46.7%), while 3rd class had the lowest (33.0%).

Children First: Children under 10 were significantly more likely to survive, supporting the "women and children first" protocol.

Wealth Effect: Higher fares correlated with better survival chances.

Age Trends: Mortality was highest among males aged 20–40 and elderly passengers.

✅ Conclusions
Survival was heavily influenced by gender, class, and age.

Societal norms and physical access to lifeboats played crucial roles.

The study supports historical accounts and provides new angles for deeper analysis.

🧠 Recommendations for Future Work
Analyze combined effects of class and gender.

Explore survival patterns within family groups.

Investigate cabin locations and their proximity to lifeboats.

Compare crew vs passenger survival statistics.
